# React's Context API: Before and After

This is the companion code for an [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) lesson showing how to replace deeply-nested "prop drilling" with React 16.3's Context.

Check out the initial commit to see the prop drilling version, and the latest commit to see how it can be improved with the Context API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
